# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

people = ['John', 'Paul', 'Sarah']

for person in people:
    if person is 'Sara':
        continue        #Skip this entry
    print(f'{person}')

# While loops execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
